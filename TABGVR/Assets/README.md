# Notice

You may notice there's no source code here, only a binary file. This is a Unity AssetBundle containing scope shaders and
modifications. I cannot legally distribute the source code of this Unity project as it contains copyrighted assets from
TABG. You can decompile it if you really want though. There is no executables in this file since AssetBundles don't
support that as a security measure, so there isn't any undocumented source code that would give you a virus or anything.
